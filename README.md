CSC3232 COURSEWORK - HOW TO PLAY

GOAL: KO your opponent by knocking them out of bounds. 

- Both you and your opponent have a DAMAGE PERCENTAGE - the higher the percentage, the further you will be knocked back when hit.
- If you or your opponent are knocked too far away from the stage, you will lose a life.
- Deplete your opponent's lives to 0 to win.


CONTROLS: (Please note, a controller is required to play as of the current version) (Controls are given in order: Xbox/Playstation/Switch)

RUN: Left Stick
- CROUCH: LB/L1/L (Crouching acts like a block, reducing incoming damage and knockback by 50% and preventing you from being launched upwards or being knocked down)
- JUMP: A/X/B or RB/R1/R (Hold the button down to jump higher; you can also jump in midair once per airtime)
- ATTACK: X/â–¡/Y (You can perform 8 different attacks; see below for instructions)
- FAST-FALL: Press Crouch in the air to increase your fall speed; can only be used when falling (after the apex of your jump)

ATTACK LIST - GROUND ATTACKS
- PUNCH: Press Attack while standing still.
- FLYING KICK: Attack while running; boosts you forward as you attack.
- LEG SWEEP: Attack while crouching.
- BACKFLIP: Press Attack + Jump at the same time.

ATTACK LIST - AIR ATTACKS
- SPIN-KICK: Press Attack without holding a direction on the stick.
- FORWARD KICK: Press Attack while holding a direction; direction of kick depends on the direction you aim towards with the left stick.
- STOMP: Press Attack + Crouch at the same time; launches opponents downwards.
- BOUNCE ATTACK: Press Attack + Jump at the same time; can be used as a second midair jump for getting back to stage, but you cannot attack or jump after using this move until you reach the ground.
